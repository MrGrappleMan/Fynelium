## Additional Notes

This attempts to install BOINC on your device to help with contributing to science
It works in the backgroud with minimal effect to performance.
Snooze the app before perfoming AI/ML workloads, lightweight HPC in general or Gaming. No effect on battery life btw!
Uninstall it if you like or your device is extremely old.
